# JsonSelector
The selector can select the elements that meet the requirements from the JSON file based on the route and destination provided by the user.
## Example:
If the path is " *(Object) -> *(Object) -> *(Object, TARGET) -> *(Object) -> *(Null)", the selector would output string values of quiz1.sport, quiz1.math, quiz2.sport and quiz2.math in example.json.
